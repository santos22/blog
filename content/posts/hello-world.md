I have always wanted to start a blog but never got around to publishing one. I would get excited about starting a blog but I could never pick an Hugo theme. Another excuse I would make is not having a cool, custom domain yet. As of today, July 7th, 2019, The United States women's national soccer team has won their fourth FIFA Women's World Cup (out of a possible 8) and I now have a blog! I aim to write about software engineering and technical documentation. I'm not sure when the first post will actually go live so down below you can find some of my previous works.

## Powering prosperous blogs at Intuit

When I started my first full time job at Intuit, the company did not have an engineering blog. I emailed Marianna Tessel, then senior VP of engineering, in the fall of 2017 about starting an engineering blog. I felt it would promote the Intuit brand and we wanted to be in same echelon of companies like Facebook and Netflix. The blog got started up shortly and I submitted a blog a post about the Groovy programming language.

## Mattermost ü§ù open source

I began my journey in open source towards the end of 2017. Mattermost, an open source Slack-alternative, was a godsend for me. I had always wanted to contribute to open source software but it was always a daunting task. I would find a project to contribute to, download the source code, get the app running, and that was it. I wouldn‚Äôt know where to go from there.

Mattermost was helpful in that it had an awesome labeling system when it came to identifying issues on GitHub. I was able to identify issues by level of difficulty and the technical area the issue would cover. I ended up writing about my first time contributing to Mattermost.

As I got more contributions under my belt, I started taking notes on the stumbling blocks I would encounter while testing my changes. I wrote about adding commands to the Mattermost command-line interface using Golang.

## Meanwhile at Winnie...

I have been working at Winnie for almost a year now. I recently wrote about the technology stack (AWS, Docker, etc.) that powers Winnie.
