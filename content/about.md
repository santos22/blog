I received a B.S. in computer science from <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/" target="_blank">Texas A&M University</a> after switching over from civil engineering. I fancied data structures a bit more than architectural structures.

I love writing software. Since creating an account on <a href="https://github.com/santos22" target="_blank">GitHub</a> in 2014, Iâ€™ve worked on various side projects. Web apps. Mobile apps. Chrome extensions. I have also made contributions to open source projects like <a href="https://mattermost.com/" target="_blank">Mattermost</a>.

If you'd like to get in touch, shoot me an [email](mailto:santosjavier22@gmail.com).
